# Instructions

This exercise does not contain code for you to directly load in your IDE (it would be too much to share here!), but you can see and download the code from GitHub.

You have to consider the test class `org.jabref.model.groups.GroupTreeNodeTest` [1] from the JabRef project [2]. Consider this test class in light of the chapter about 'Test code quality' (Chapter 10) and what we have discussed in class about this topic.

1. Do you think this class contains tests that should be refactored?
  - If you do not think so, explain why the current implementation is reasonable and improvements would not be possible in a `answer.md` file that you put in this folder.
  - On the contrary, if you think the test class can and should be refactored, in addition to explaining why in a `answer.md` file that you put in this folder, create a new version of this test class that you also put in this folder.
