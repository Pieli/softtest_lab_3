# GroupTreeNodeTest.java

        The test class does a good job at testing the general adding and removing of nodes in a group.
        It misses alot of methods defined in GroupTreeNode.java like:
        1. The equals() method
        2. The getMatchingGroups() method
        3. The getEntriesInGroup() method
        4. The copyNode() method
        5. toString() method
        6. isSameGroupAs() method

        That's why 6 new tests have been added to the new GroupTreeNodeeTest.java to increase coverage.
